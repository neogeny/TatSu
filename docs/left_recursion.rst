Left Recursion
--------------

|TatSu| supports direct and indirect left recursion in grammar rules using the the algorithm described by *Nicolas Laurent* and *Kim Mens* in their 2015 paper_ *Parsing Expression Grammars Made Practical*.

The design and implementation of left recursion was done by `Vic Nightfall`_
with help and research by `Nicolas Laurent`_ on Autumn_, and `Philippe
Sigaud`_ on PEGGED_.

.. _Autumn: https://github.com/norswap/autumn
.. _PEGGED: https://github.com/PhilippeSigaud/Pegged/wiki/Left-Recursion

Left recursive rules produce left-associative parse trees (AST_), as most users would expect,
*except if some of the rules involved recurse on the right (a pending topic)*.

.. _paper: http://norswap.com/pubs/sle2015.pdf

Left recursion support is enabled by default in |TatSu|. To disable it for a particular grammar, use the ``@@left_recursion`` directive:

.. code:: ocaml

    @@left_recursion :: False


.. warning::

    Not all left-recursive grammars that use the |TatSu| syntax are PEG_ (the same happens with right-recursive grammars). **The order of rules matters in PEG**.

    For right-recursive grammars the choices that parse the most input must come first. The same is true  for left-recursive grammars.
